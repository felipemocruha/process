# Design process

### 1. Define the problem (Big Hairy Audacious Goal)
 - Create a phrase that represents the problem to be solved
 
### 2. Loop for each release

 - #### 2.1 Assemble a list of desirable features
  
 - #### 2.2 Filter and analyse
    - Break big features into smaller ones
    - Cut off (or delay) unecessary features
    - Add features that emerge from the selected ones (hidden dependencies and requirements)
    - Simplify features (is there a way to make things simpler?)
    - Create issues
    
 - #### 2.3 Sketch a solution
    - Figure out how to create an evolutionary architecture
    - Experiment ways to solve the problem
    
 - #### 2.4 Order the list by dependencies
    - Gantt charts?
    - Create a kanban and milestones
    - Define fitness functions
 
 - #### 2.5 Get shit done!
    - Code the features (focus on making things work)
    - Don't forget to do fucking tests! (of course you won't, but don't procrastinate)
    - Make it deployable
 
 - #### 2.6 Clean up and refactor
    - Organize and clean the code
 
 - #### 2.7 Release it!
 
 - #### 2.8 Deploy
